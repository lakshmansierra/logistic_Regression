# Accuracy
```bash
Positive = 1 = left 
Negative = 0 = stay 
```

```bash
TN = 17   (actually stay & Predicted stay)
FP = 0    (actually stay & Predicted left)
FN = 1    (actually left & Predicted stay)
TP = 2    (actually left & Predicted left)
```

```bash
[[TN FP]
 [FN TP]]
```

```bash
Accuracy = (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)
= (2 + 17) / 20 = 19 / 20 = 0.95 → 95%

Precision = TP / (TP + FP)
= 2 / (2 + 0) = 1.0

Recall = TP / (TP + FN)
= 2 / (2 + 1) = 0.6667 → 66.67%

F1 Score = 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)
= 2 * (1 * 0.6667) / (1 + 0.6667)
= 1.3334 / 1.6667 ≈ 0.8 → 80%
```
